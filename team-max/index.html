            <h4>Max's Story</h4>
            <p>Max originally entered our family with his brother and litter mate, Archie Houdini Von Wishkabibble at the age of 3 months old. They brought with them lots of energy and the dirtiest apple toy I've ever seen. They were infamous for causing messes. Archie would get them into places they shouldn't be &lpar;Houdini&rpar;, while Max would leave evidence that they had been there &lpar;Whodunnit&rpar;.</p>
            <pa>Sadly, Archie was not with us very long before he succumbed to a terrible immune system disease. During his illness, Max became the best brother and care taker of Archie. He waited for his brother and even engaged him in play when Archie was well enough to do so. He loved his brother so much and was lost when after just two years he moved over the rainbow bridge. Max was not alone for long, welcoming in new baby brother, Kirby, to our home. Max showed him the ropes and they soon were like peas and carrots.</pa>
            <p> Max is such a wonderful boy who loves snuggles and belly rubs. He also gives the best hugs and loves it if you give him kisses. He is also loves to patrol the neighborhood from the front window and keep the yard free of any pesky squirrels. </p>
